# El rol de la curvatura en la preferència estètica visual

This repository contains the materials and code from my Final Degree Project (TFG) in Computational Mathematics and Data Analytics at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

The project explores how curvature impacts visual aesthetic preferences, combining mathematical and perceptual perspectives. It includes:

- Literature review on aesthetics and curvature perception
- Experimental design for visual preference testing
- Data analysis in R (descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, modeling)
- Final report and presentation

The goal is to understand whether humans tend to prefer curved over angular shapes, and how this can be quantified and analyzed mathematically.
